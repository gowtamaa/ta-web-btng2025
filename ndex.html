        Heavy - The Marias
    </h2 class="dark:text-white-600">
    <p>I'm heavy<br>
    I'm by your side<br>
    Forget me<br>
    'Cause I know what I need<br>
    Like a loser like me could be fine<br>
    <br><br>
    I'm heavy<br>
    Alone inside<br>
    Don't tell me what I want, what I need<br>
    Like a loser like me will be fine<br>
    Maybe I'm living in my head<br>
    Maybe I'm living to pretend<br>
    <br><br>
    Maybe I wanna stay in bed<br>
    Far from the weight of the world in my hands<br>
    'Cause they don't understand<br>
    <br><br>
    Is someone telling me don't get in the water?<br>
    What have I done?<br>
    I don't wanna get lost inside the color under my tongue<br>
    'Cause I don't wanna be in love with another<br>
    Even in another life<br>
    Can someone tell me it's alright to be covered<br>
    Underneath the covers? But I<br>
    <br><br>
    No, I don't need to sleep anymore<br>
    Is someone banging at my door?<br>
    When I just wanna be alone?<br>
    Is someone banging at my door?<br>
    Je ne sais pas qui est ici<br>
    Is someone banging at my door<br>
    When I just wanna be alone<br>
    Is someone banging at my door, door, door, door?<br>
    Door, door, door, door, at my door <br>
    Is someone banging at my door?<br>
    <br><br>
   </p>
